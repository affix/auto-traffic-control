**Auto Traffic Control** is a video game played by programming. The player's
task is to create a program that can safely manage the airspace above two
airports.

The game is designed to provide an open-ended sandbox that players can use to
freely practice programming. The game provides a language-agnostic gRPC API,
giving players free choice of programming language or paradigm.

This crate contains the auto-generated Node SDK for the game's gRPC API.

## Usage

First, install `auto-traffic-control` as a new dependency:

```shell
pip install auto-traffic-control
```

Or install it locally by cloning the source repo and running:

```shell
cd sdk/python
python -m pip install .
```

If build fails, try to upgrade your `pip` and try again:
`python -m pip install -U pip`.

Then, create a service client and send a request. Check out the
[documentation](https://auto-traffic-control.com) to learn about the different
services and their endpoints.

The following Python [example](../../examples/python/play.py) queries
the version of the game through the
[`AtcService`](https://auto-traffic-control.com/docs/api/Services/atc-service).
